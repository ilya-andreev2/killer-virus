## Code Instructions

Download this repository and run the desired _T##-code.R_ code in RStudio. The code was not tested thoroughly on Mac, only Windows.

The R files in each folder generally follow the same structure, adapted to the particular experimental settings. If this is your first time running this code, we recommend starting with _T10-code.R_ (QTL mapping) as it's slightly better annotated.
